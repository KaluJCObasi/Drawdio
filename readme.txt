abstract:
---
Drawdio (a portmanteau of 'draw' and 'audio') creates an animated drawing
using parameters gathered from audio file input. First, it takes in an audio
file as an array of double values. Then, it finds the average value in each of
three subsections of this array. Next, it turns these averages into integers
between 0 and 255 and uses these integers to create colors. These colors are used
to create animations of concentric shapes.
In this way, the audio input determines the colors used in the drawing.
